# Plane crash dataset visualisation

An app made using the streamlit framework which visualises (most of) the plane crashes that 
have occurred all over the world since 1900.

All the data was scraped from this site: http://www.planecrashinfo.com/database.htm

To run locally, run `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal.

The app has been deployed here:
